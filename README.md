## HenPartyGamesApp

A small app, that includes 3 drinking party games:
- Never Have I ever
- Would you rather
- Drunk Pictionary

If you use UI, you can expand an area for one of the games by clicking on it and than for never Have I Ever and Would You Rather click on the button to generate a statement/question. For Drunk Pictionary select a Category from the dropdown and the object to draw will be displayed below.

If you want to run it by yourself, you will need to install streamlit and run a command in terminel to start: streamlit run games_app.py
